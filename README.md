# Project Description

The room has four main features. First, there’s a carnival style test your strength game, to represent feats of strength. Second, there’s the traditional festivus aluminum pole that spins on click. Third, there’s a PA system for airing your grievances! Finally, there is the Festivus dinner table, which is not interactive at this time.
